Eatout is an attempt to combine food and social networking. The main motive of the app is to be able to create spontaneous events, and invite your friends and family for a quick bite or drinks. This app also allows us to see where our friends are planning to visit. It provides an easy to use interface through which the user can view nearby events on the map. The user can create a new event or request to join a public event.
